# Challenge 2
You are given a Python script `event_scheduler.py` for an event scheduler. The script is supposed to take a list of event names and their start times, then schedule them and print the schedule. However, there are several bugs in the script, including logic errors and incorrect data handling.

- Run the script and observe the output. It will not match the expected output.
- Use `pdb` to step through the code and inspect variables.
- Identify and fix the bugs in the script.
- Ensure that the script works as intended.
